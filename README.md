This is the original source code/Unity project of the game with everything included. The recommended Unity version for this is Unity 2018.4.36f1, but you should be able to safely port it to newer versions.

The project is quite a mess and it might be hard to figure out how this whole thing even works, so the best you can do is probably just use this for modding and stuff. You will also need Android Studio if you want to make an Android build of the game.

There's no license for this thing, so any sort of modding or modyfing is fully allowed. Don't forget to credit me for making the game if you're going to heavily modify it! :D
